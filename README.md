# Rescheduling-multi-depot-multi-trip-rurall-postman-problem-instances
This repository contains failure scenarios to test algorithms developed to handle multiple vehicle failures in multi-depot rural postman problem with rechargeable and reusable vehicles capable of performing multiple trips 

## Capacitated Arc Routing Problem (CARP) Instances:
The failure scenarios are created from CARP instances from the literature. Three well known CARP instances are used namely
1. GDB
2. BCCM
3. EGLESE

These instances can be found in "CARP instances" folder in the root directory of the respository. These instances are originally obtained from [here](https://www.uv.es/belengue/carp.html).
